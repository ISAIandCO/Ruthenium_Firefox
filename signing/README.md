# Public Rufox debug key

`rfirefox-debug.keystore` is an intentionally public Android debug keystore used
only for releases whose Firefox version ends in `_debug`.

Configuration:

- store type: JKS;
- alias: `androiddebugkey`;
- store password: `android`;
- key password: `android`;
- certificate SHA-256:
  `d7a19050129bbb6e7af6f29dc899a123757ca226ea0ee3c7395c43527592035f`.

The workflow passes this file to the Fenix build through the
`RFIREFOX_DEBUG_KEYSTORE` environment variable. It verifies both the keystore
certificate and the certificate in every resulting APK against
`debug-key-lock.json`/the pinned workflow value.

This key provides signature continuity between Rufox debug builds, but no
publisher authentication: anyone who clones the repository has the private key
and can sign an APK accepted as an update. Never reuse this key for production.
